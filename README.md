# BlenderAssets
Blender assets that will be made by kids at school, me (the teacher), or anyone who wants to contribute.

# Let's be clear
This is a repository I created because it's unfortunate that we don't have open-source software with all the assets we need to produce everything we want at home. I believe it's the task of my government to provide the necessary resources to use every possibility humans have developed to do that. Since I currently work as a teacher, I will not complain but take action. Feel free to participate.
Since you cannot produce without a machine to transform matter, the first thing is to build one. That will be a project for students at school. There are many machines out there, but not one with the capabilities needed to handle the right needs and fulfill the right constraints.
